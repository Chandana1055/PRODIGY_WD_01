A responsive coffee shop landing page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring a fixed interactive navbar, scroll effects, hover animations, and a mobile-friendly design.
Brew Haven is a modern and fully responsive coffee shop landing page developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a fixed navigation bar that changes style on scroll, smooth scrolling between sections, interactive hover effects, and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu. It includes a visually appealing hero section with a coffee-themed background, an About section, a Menu section with responsive coffee item cards, a Gallery with image hover animations, and a Contact section.

This project demonstrates key front-end development concepts such as responsive design using Flexbox and Grid, CSS transitions and animations, and JavaScript DOM manipulation for interactive user experiences. It is suitable for portfolio presentation, academic submission, or internship showcase.
